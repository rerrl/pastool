Goals:

- Rust based desktop password manager utilizing Password Store
- Make easy to use for someone new to the software
- Idea is to be able to recommend this to someone who isnt very techy and needs a password manager
- Make familiar for someone who is experienced with Pass specifically (power users can still find this useful in one way or another, though dmenu is superior for quick access)
- hotkey accessibility, task manager integration
- make search just like dmenu search
- open source
- cross platform (windows, linux, macos)
